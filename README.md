Bring in file

Parse each line and look for keywords

When keywords found, parse line to retain who attacked who and if they hit for how much of each type of damage

for each file:
    we can parse it and just print a graph for a single attacker by hard coding their name as in line 60 in read_in_file.py
    OR
    for each unique attacker
        separate dataframes with attack and damage information are retained to allow for dynamic graph creation for all unique attackers
